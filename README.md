# Team Contract

## Communication

1. **Team Meetings** 
We will have weekly in-person hour-long meetings. Mondays at 8 pm CST. Everyone will take turns taking notes throughout the meetings
2. **Assistance** 
We have set up a group chat where anyone is free to send messages. Group members should expect a response within 24 hours of sending the message.

3. **Respect**
Every team member will be given an opportunity to share their ideas to make sure that it is an inclusive environment. Taking notes will also ensure that people are paying attention to what is happening.


## Collaboration


4. **Work Distribution**
Each group member will be given a set of responsibilities on a week to week basis. The responsibilities for the next week will be determined during the weekly meetings. In the event of an unexpected complication, we will determine resolving steps during the weekly meetings. This could include redistributing the work loads and reevaluating weekly goals. We will determine responsibilities based off of group member strengths so that we can get the best out of everyone.

5. **Time Commitment** 
Each week each group member will put in at least 2 hours of work to contribute to the project to make sure everyone is doing their part. If there is an issue with a member not completing their work, other group members can assist to finish any incomplete work.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If there are any conflicts of interest within the group, we will have a group meeting that will consist of polls that will help resolve the issue. This would allow for the group to come up with a fair solution after hearing out both of the opposing arguments.
